        explanation="Assertions are not checked at runtime. There are ways to request that they be used by Dalvik (`adb shell setprop debug.assert 1`), but note that this is not implemented in ART (the newer runtime), and even in Dalvik the property is ignored in many places and can not be relied upon. Instead, perform conditional checking inside `if (BuildConfig.DEBUG) { }` blocks. That constant is a static final boolean which is true in debug builds and false in release builds, and the Java compiler completely removes all code inside the if-body from the app.&#xA;&#xA;For example, you can replace `assert speed > 0` with `if (BuildConfig.DEBUG &amp;&amp; !(speed > 0)) { throw new AssertionError() }`.&#xA;&#xA;(Note: This lint check does not flag assertions purely asserting nullness or non-nullness; these are typically more intended for tools usage than runtime checks.)"

        explanation="The `allowBackup` attribute determines if an application&apos;s data can be backed up and restored. It is documented at http://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.attr.html#allowBackup&#xA;&#xA;By default, this flag is set to `true`. When this flag is set to `true`, application data can be backed up and restored by the user using `adb backup` and `adb restore`.&#xA;&#xA;This may have security consequences for an application. `adb backup` allows users who have enabled USB debugging to copy application data off of the device. Once backed up, all application data can be read by the user. `adb restore` allows creation of application data from a source specified by the user. Following a restore, applications should not assume that the data, file permissions, and directory permissions were created by the application itself.&#xA;&#xA;Setting `allowBackup=&quot;false&quot;` opts an application out of both backup and restore.&#xA;&#xA;To fix this warning, decide whether your application should support backup, and explicitly set `android:allowBackup=(true|false)&quot;`.&#xA;&#xA;If not set to false, and if targeting API 23 or later, lint will also warn that you should set `android:fullBackupContent` to configure auto backup."
